# **DONUTSTAFF**

A Simple Staff Mode plugin for you Minecraft Server. This plugin goals to lightweight and fast. At the moment, is on a 
BETA phase, so please report any bugs that you can find. Also, you can suggest new features to let me implemented.

As the name states, this plugin was created for the **DonutCraft Games Network**.
# **FEATURES**

_At the moment, it comes with the basic features, but as I said, it's in BETA so in the near future I will be adding more
and cool features._

- Staff Mode --> Is the basic mode of this plugin.
  - When a player activates this mode, his inventory will be saved in cache, and he will receive the staff mode items. 
    After disabling the mode, he will get back his items.
- Vanish Mode --> you can enable it and disable it while in StaffMode.
  - Players with the permission _donutstaff.seestaff_ will be able to see the vanished players.
- RandomTP --> You can teleport to a random online player without them getting noticed.
- FakeLeave --> You can fake your leave of the server when getting in StaffMode
  - The message can be changed in the plugins files.
- KbStick --> It's a simple stick with the knock back enchantment that you can use to check if the player has anti-knock 
  back
- Freeze Command --> With this command you can freeze the players that you think are hacking. While they are frozen, 
  they will only be able to talk in chat.
- Clear Chat --> It comes with a built-in clear chat command.
- Staff Chat --> A private chat only for staffs.

**INCOMING**
- Revive command --> With this command you will be able to give back the inventory of a player that has died.
  - It will have a limit time, such as 5 minutes, for performance reasons.
    
- If you want me to add more things, you can suggest them in my discord.
